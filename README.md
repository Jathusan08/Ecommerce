I have built a real-time e-commerce application and it is full stack application.

I have used angular for front-end

I have used Spring Boot for back-end

The front end and back end will communicate using a REST API

For the back end, I have a database setup already that will have full CRUD support for our given database

In order to check each function working as expected, I have tested them using the combination of unit testing and MockMvc.
