I have built a real-time e-commerce application and it is full stack application.

I have used angular for front-end

I have used Java and Spring Boot for back-end

The front end and back end will communicate using a REST API with the help of Spring Data REST.

For the back end, I have a database setup already that will have full CRUD support for our given database with the help of Spring Data JPA.

In order to check each function working as expected, I have tested them using the combination of unit testing and MockMvc with the help of H2 embedded database.
